# Identifying Subgroups of Children — PTM202 Study

## Executive Summary
The primary goal is investigating how PTM202 affects environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) in Bangladeshi Infants. Primarily, PTM202 was determined that it did not have an effect on EED. Our new goal is to determine if there is a subgroup of children who can benefit from the nutritional supplement and how to identify those children so that a targeted intervention can be developed. To perform LASSO and model-based tree methods, models with each of five response variables—WAZ, MPO, Reg1b, sCD14, and CRP—are fitted.

## Introduction
A randomized placebo control trial was conducted to determine how PTM202 affected environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) in Bangladeshi Infants. In the earlier study, PTM202 was determined that it did not have an effect on EED. The client-based interest of this report is to determine if there is a subgroup in which an effect was observed. The new goal is to determine if there is a subgroup of children who can benefit from the nutritional supplement and how to identify those children so that a targeted intervention can be developed.

## Data and Analysis
Since the trial was over a short period of time, weight is likely more useful than height. To measure how WAS has changed, I get difference values of WAZ5 (vtime = 5; Final) – WAZ2 (vtime = 2; Start of Intervention) from the anthropometric data. After omitting missing values, 178 out of 200 observations are left.
